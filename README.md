### Project Overview

#### 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of a business case where I was hired as a data analyst by XYZ, supporting one of India’s leading online marketplaces. The client wanted to measure, manage, and analyse their business performance with a focus on customer behaviour, seller trends, product popularity, and payment channel insights.

I conducted comprehensive data cleaning, SQL analysis, and interactive dashboarding in Power BI, validated through Excel pivot tables and Power Query.


#### 🎯 Business Objectives
The client shared a set of core business questions to address, including (but not limited to):
•	How is the business performing in terms of sales, customers, and products?
•	What’s the trend in customer acquisition and retention?
•	Which products/categories are most and least popular?
•	How are customers paying, and what’s their satisfaction level?
•	Can we segment customers and sellers based on revenue?


#### 💼 My Role
As the analyst, I was responsible for turning raw data into actionable insights across SQL Server, Power BI, and Excel. I built an end-to-end solution with clear visuals, KPIs, and business storytelling.
