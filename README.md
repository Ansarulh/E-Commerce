### Project Overview

#### 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of a business case where I was hired as a data analyst by XYZ, supporting one of India’s leading online marketplaces. The client wanted to measure, manage, and analyse their business performance with a focus on customer behaviour, seller trends, product popularity, and payment channel insights.

I conducted comprehensive data cleaning, SQL analysis, and interactive dashboarding in Power BI, validated through Excel pivot tables and Power Query.


#### 🎯 Business Objectives
The client shared a set of core business questions to address, including (but not limited to):
•	How is the business performing in terms of sales, customers, and products?
•	What’s the trend in customer acquisition and retention?
•	Which products/categories are most and least popular?
•	How are customers paying, and what’s their satisfaction level?
•	Can we segment customers and sellers based on revenue?


#### 💼 My Role
As the analyst, I was responsible for turning raw data into actionable insights across SQL Server, Power BI, and Excel. I built an end-to-end solution with clear visuals, KPIs, and business storytelling.

### 📝 Recommendations & Next Steps.
#### Based on the insights from this analysis, here are some strategic recommendations for the business:
##### 1.	Expand Operations in High-Revenue States
Andhra Pradesh contributes nearly 60% of total revenue. Focus marketing efforts, promotions, and inventory expansion in this region, while exploring why other states like Goa have low engagement.
##### 2.	Target High-Converting Time Slots
Peak sales occur between 10 AM – 11 PM. Run promotions or time-limited deals during these hours to maximize conversions.
##### 3.	Simplify and Promote Credit Card Payments
Since 78% of customers use credit cards, offering exclusive card-based discounts or cashback could improve retention and boost revenue further.
##### 4.	Customer Segmentation Strategy
###### With over 90% of customers in the <₹1K revenue segment, consider:

o	Upselling/cross-selling strategies

o	Personalized offers for the ₹1K–₹5K segment

o	Loyalty programs to increase lifetime value

##### 5.	Seller Development Program
###### Since 82% of sellers are low performers:

o	Offer seller training on product visibility, pricing, and customer service

o	Introduce a “Seller Success Toolkit” to help them scale revenue

o	Create tiered seller incentives

##### 6.	Improve Low-Rated Categories
###### Address poor ratings in "security_and_services" and "office_furniture" by:

o	Gathering more granular customer feedback

o	Vetting sellers in these categories

o	Improving product descriptions and quality control

##### 7.	Leverage Power BI Dashboards for Ongoing Monitoring
The dashboards created in this project can serve as templates for real-time monitoring by teams across sales, marketing, product, and operations.
